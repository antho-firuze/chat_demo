# chat_demo

Flutter Chat Demo.

## Note

This project is a starting point for a Chat System using Flutter + WebSocket.

<!-- ## To get this work :

- First, you can use WebSocket/SSE Server or realtime database like Supabase, to exchanged the SDP (Session Description Protocol) between caller & callee. This is commonly called Signaling Server.
- And optionally setup a STUN/TURN Server. This is necessary if your network behind Symetric NAT / Firewall. -->

<!-- ## Supabase Setup

- Create table presenter `(enable realtime)`
  {id, created_at, label, heartbeat, device_id, state}
- Create table audience `(enable realtime)`
  {id, created_at, presenter_id, device_id, heartbeat, offer, answer, state} -->

## Flutter Setup

- `git clone https://github.com/antho-firuze/chat_demo.git`
- `cd chat_demo`
- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run`
